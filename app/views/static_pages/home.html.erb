    Bookmarkulum is an application that stores web bookmarks.
    
    <p>
      Each bookmark has a title, an URL and a shortening. The title and URL are both required,
the shorting will be generated by the system if empty. Each bookmark belongs to a site. Each
site has a top level URL, which is created together with the bookmark if it's not already there.
  </p>
  <p>
For example if someone adds two bookmarks with the following URLs:
"http://reddit.com/cats" and "http://reddit.com/dogs", and there is no site with the URL
"http://reddit.com", it will be created when the first bookmark is added. The application should
allow user to create, edit, list and search bookmarks.

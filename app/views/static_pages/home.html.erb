      Bookmarkulum is an application that stores web bookmarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each bookmark has a title, an URL and a shortening. The title and URL are both required,
      the shorting will be generated by the system if empty. Each bookmark belongs to a site. Each
      site has a top level URL, which is created together with the bookmark if it's not already there.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example if someone adds two bookmarks with the following URLs:
      "http://reddit.com/cats" and "http://reddit.com/dogs", and there is no site with the URL
      "http://reddit.com", it will be created when the first bookmark is added. The application should
      allow user to create, edit, list and search bookmarks.
